## Identity

**Intelligent System Architect**  
Designing, optimizing, and controlling the life cycle of complex systems
through data, mathematics, and physical control.

I aim to go beyond writing code or maintaining machines.
My focus is on pushing system performance to its limits by integrating
**Industrial Engineering (optimization & strategy)** with
**Electrical & Electronic Engineering (control & physical realization)**.

## Core Axes

### 1. Industrial Engineering — *Strategic Optimization*
- Mathematical optimization (OR / AI)
- Reliability & system lifetime trade-offs
- Bottleneck analysis and value quantification
- Defining *what* should be optimized and *why*

### 2. Electrical & Electronic Engineering — *Physical Control*
- Signal processing for system health monitoring
- Control theory for real-world execution
- Real-time decision-making under physical constraints
- Translating optimal values into hardware actions

### 3. Intersection — *PdM & System-Level Optimization*
- Predictive Maintenance (PdM) grounded in physical understanding
- Real-time optimization of cyber-physical systems
- Digital Twin–based system design and control
- Peak performance with predictive health management

---

## Goal

To become a system-level engineer who:
- Sets optimal objectives mathematically
- Executes them precisely through physical control
- Maximizes performance without sacrificing reliability

*Examples: intelligent mobility systems, robotics, energy management systems.*
